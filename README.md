# MiniProject
A project for the Game Physics course of GMT, UU

The specific project was build on the Unity engine. It has various simulation of phenomena happening in outer space, based on the formulas explained in the course, without using Unity's physics engine. 

The scenes (in Assets/Scenes) depict our solar system (SolarSystem), a planet with a moon orbiting a star (SampleScene), a gravity assist scene, where a spaceship is changing its course with the assistance of a planet's orbit (GravityAssistSceneSpaceship), and a meteorite entering a planet and the planet's atmosphere that has a drag force against the meteorite (Meteorite). The rest of the scenes are for the final submission and need refining. All scenes have a timescale UI during playtime, which is adjustable in order to increase the speed.

Double-click on the scene you want to check and press the Play button (or Ctrl+P). The scripts are in Assets/Scripts. We also have used some assets to make the scenes look more appealing and beautiful.
